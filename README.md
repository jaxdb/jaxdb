### Introduction

**DBx** is a Java framework for binding to RDBMS data models. Based on the CohesionFirst™ approach, the **DBx** framework provides a strongly-typed and cohesive approach to connect the DB tier to the business tier.

### Why **DBx**?

#### CohesionFirst™

Developed with the CohesionFirst™ approach, **DBx** is reliably designed, consistently implemented, and straightforward to use. Made possible by the rigorous conformance to design patterns and best practices in every line of its implementation, **DBx** is a complete binding solution between the DB tier and the business tier. The **DBx** solution differentiates itself from the rest with the strength of its cohesion to the Java language and the SQL DDL and DML models.
